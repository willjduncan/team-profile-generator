## Description

AS A manager

I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info

SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

<!-- README Generator is a program that creates READMEs. As such: -->

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information

THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML

THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

WHEN I click on the GitHub username

THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

WHEN I start the application

THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

WHEN I select the engineer option

THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

WHEN I select the intern option

THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu

WHEN I decide to finish building my team

THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

This project had to be accomplished with careful planning, first setting up the necessary scaffolding according to the Challenge guidelines, then downloading the necessary tools, including npm, inquirer, and Jest. From there, the tests had to be established for each Class, before any building of the Classes could commence. 

<!-- This project was designed to familiarize myself better with Node.js. The completed project should allow me and whoever uses the program to more quickly and easily render README files for future projects and challenges, thus leaving more time to work with actual code. The READMEs should be high-quality and the template dynamic so that it can work in different situations. By the end, I should feel more comfortable with Node and back-end development, thus allowing me to continue confidently in my learning.  -->


## Installation

<!-- Links to the repository and deployed website can be found at [Questions](#questions).

Because this project runs from the machine and not the browser, it cannot be deployed. The project is on github, however. You must first clone the repo, then run the command "npm install" on the Terminal/Command Line in order to download the dependencies. From there, you can create your own README.  -->


## Usage

<!-- Once the project is cloned and the dependencies downloaded, type "node index" to run the program. The program will provide you with multiple prompts to fill out, including description, picking a license, lising credits, and so forth. Fill them out with your respective information. When you're done, your new README should appear in the dist folder for you to copy and place in your own personal project. 

An example of the markdown code is below:

## Credits

<!-- The coding boot camp Professional README Guide found at https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide was used as a template for this README. 
The license was picked from [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
Other credits include: 
Bootcamp Modules, Bootcamp Challenges, npm
No TAs or classmates were used in the making of this challenge. Most influence was taken particualrly from Module 9. Node.js and NPM's Inquirer were also used. Tterb's github repository for README badges found at [https://gist.github.com/tterb/982ae14a9307b80117dbf49f624ce0e8](https://gist.github.com/tterb/982ae14a9307b80117dbf49f624ce0e8) was used to get the badges. -->



## Contributing

<!-- Other items to be added can be badges, further options for credits, additional license options, ways to easily upload screenshots, a way to easily toss in the User Story and Acceptance Criteria, and a place to add features. Any other additions are certainly welcome. Just don't break anything.  -->


## Tests

<!-- In order to test, you'll simply need to run the application and try out different combos. You can also create mock data to test the layout and presentation of that data.  -->
